# WWTDDiscordBot
A Discord bot that replicates the card game "Moral Dilemma" for you and your friends' enjoyment.

## How to Use
Keep decks in folder that are in the same directory as the bot files. In each deck folder, have a "nsfw" and "sfw" folder that contains the appropriate card. In each of those folders, add .txt files that represent each card.

Insert your bot token in the TOKEN variable in main.py, and run the bot. Use the @manual function for instructions how the bot is used.
